# Start Your Node Server



Before proceeding to following steps, make sure you have **Node** installed in your machine.

1. Clone project.

2. Open project's **middleware** directory in CLI/Terminal.

3. Run `npm i` to install node modules. Ignore if you have already installed.

4. Install **nodemon** globally using `npm i -g nodemon`. **nodemon** watches the file changes and restarts your node server automatically.

5. Start server by running `npm start`.


It is recommended to install **Postman** desktop application to validate APIs you are working on. Thanks!
